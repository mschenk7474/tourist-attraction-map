# Overview
Have you ever traveled through a US State and thought "Man, this state is so boring, there is nothing to do here." Well, I will be honest, I have done that very thing, so to combat that, I have created a web application to display each state's top tourist attraction so that you can find something to do in each state. I also created this web app to further my knowledge of JavaScript, and how to implement data being pulled from the internet. Another reason I created this was that I have never done anything with ArcGIS mapping, so I wanted to experiment in that field by creating a simple, but yet very useful map.

How you use this map is simple. First, you go to the link section of this repository and see a link that looks something like this 'mschenk7474.github.io/tourist-attraction-map/'. I will add a link to the website [here](https://mschenk7474.github.io/tourist-attraction-map/) for your convenience. On this map, you will see 50 points for each of the 50 states. Each point has a corresponding color, which tells you if the top attraction for that state is either nature-based, amusement-based, or museum-based. When you click on a certain point, you will see that it is in the correct location, and you will have a nice little pop-up that tells and shows you some interesting things. Each of the pop-ups will tell you what category that pop-up belongs to, the name of the attraction, which state it resides in, and an image of the attraction.

# Development Environment
I used the following to create this web app:
* Visual Studio Code - IDE
* HTML, JavaScript - Languages
* ArcGIS - Packages/Libraries
* GitHub Pages - Hosting

# Useful Websites
* [JSON Data](https://github.com/mschenk7474/top-tourist-attraction-USA-states-json)
* [GIS Mapping Workshop](https://replit.com/@MasonSchenk/CSE310GISMappingWorkshop#map.js)
* [Displaying an ArcGIS Map in JavaScript and HTML](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/display-a-map/)
* [ArcGIS Maps and Views](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/maps-and-views/)

# Future Work
* Add more points for different parts of the world
* Add more information in the pop-up of each point
* Add a legend explaining what the different colors mean for the points
